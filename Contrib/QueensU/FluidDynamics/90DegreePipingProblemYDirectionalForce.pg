BEGIN_PGML

Water flows into a [`90^{\circ}`] pipe elbow through a flange, and flows out through a nozzle. The pipe is [`4`][`"`] SCH 40, and water flows through the pipe with a velocity of [`V_{1} = [$V1]`] [`m/s`]. The nozzle has a diameter of [`d = [$d]`] [`cm`]. The additional dimensions of the pipe, as depicted in the diagram below, are [`W = 25`] [`cm`], and [`H = 28`] [`cm`]. The gauge pressure at the flange is [`P = [$P]`] [`kPa`]. Gravity acts in the z-direction (i.e. neglect mass of the pipe and water).

What is the force, in Newtons, that the flange must be able to sustain in the *y-direction?*



Discussion: What elements of the pipe's geometry affect the x-directional reaction force seen at the flange?
