BEGIN_PGML

We assumed that the tank in the picture was large, with circular jets.

[@ image('2Orifice3TesttheLargeTankAssumption.png', width=>203, height=>253) @]*

 

If the cross-sectional area of the tank is actually [`1`] [`m^{2}`] from the top down to location [`1`], then drops linearly to [`0.4`] [`m^{2}`] at location [`2`], how does this change your answer for the velocities?  
[@ $mc->buttons() @]*
