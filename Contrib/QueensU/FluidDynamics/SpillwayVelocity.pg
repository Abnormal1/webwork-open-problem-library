BEGIN_PGML

The water pouring over the spillway on a dam accelerates as shown in this figure from http://www.expertwatercfd.com/?q=content/applications/spillways. (Blue is very low velocity, increasing towards the red zone.) The flow can be quite complex and require computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to model, especially if the geometry is 3 dimensional. 

[@ image('SpillwayVelocity.png', width=>514, height=>244) @]*

Make reasonable approximations to estimate the velocity of the water about [`2/3`] of the way down this spillway, a position at an elevation [`h = [$H]`] [`m`] lower than the surface of the calm reservoir behind the dam.

Discussion: What assumptions are necessary for your solution?

Would your answer be different if this was salt water, with a significantly higher density?
