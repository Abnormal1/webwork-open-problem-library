This is a README file for practice.

A README file needs to be made when you put new problems because when jon Jones vets this he wants to know who is this,
who does this collection of files belong to, and so on and so forth. 
Look at the README file for the WebWork Open Problem Library to see what type of info needs to be in this file. 


1. I created GitHub account
2. I forked the webwork-open-problem-library, this copied the open library to my personal account, so I now technically have access to all the open library as well as the contrib and pending directories.
3. I create a README file in the contrib folder in my personal github and can contribute a problem there.
4. Then I request my contrib be merged with the real open problem library (this part I am a bit unsure of at the moment)
