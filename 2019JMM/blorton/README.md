This is a README file for practice.

A README file needs to be made when you put new problems because when jon Jones vets this he wants to know who is this,
who does this collection of files belong to, and so on and so forth. 
Look at the README file for the WebWork Open Problem Library to see what type of info needs to be in this file.
